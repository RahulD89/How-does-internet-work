The Role of Protocols in Internet
Protocals play a critical role in enabling communication and data exchange over the internet .
IP => Internet Protocal
TCP => Transmission Control Protocal 
DNS => Domain Name System
UDP => User Datagram Protocal


IP is responsible for routing packets of data to their correct destination, while TCP & UDP ensure that packets are transmitted relaibly and effciently 
DNS is used to translate domain names into IP addressess, and HTTP is used to transfer data between clients and servers.

One of the key benefits of using standardized protocols os that they allow devices and system from different manufacturers and vendors to communicate with each other seamlessly . for example a browser is developed by one compamny can communicate with a web browser developed by another company,as long as they both adhere to the HTTP protocol.
